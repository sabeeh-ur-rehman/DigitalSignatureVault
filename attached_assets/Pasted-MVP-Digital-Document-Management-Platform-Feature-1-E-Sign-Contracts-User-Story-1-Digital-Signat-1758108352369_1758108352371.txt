MVP – Digital Document Management Platform
Feature 1: E-Sign Contracts
User Story 1 – Digital Signature

As a manager,
I want clients to sign documents digitally,
so that contracts are legally acknowledged without the need for printing or scanning.

Scenario / Workflow:

Upload PDF Document

Manager uploads a document such as a proposal, contract, NDA, or agreement.

Supported formats: .pdf (future enhancement: .docx).

Open in E-Sign Editor

The uploaded PDF opens in an editable viewer.

Manager can:

Create a new signature using a signature pad or typing tool.

Choose a saved signature from previously stored options.

Drag and drop the signature onto the required location in the document.

Generate Secure Signing Link

Manager clicks on “Generate Secure Link”.

A unique, encrypted URL is generated (similar to a Google Drive share link).

This link can be copied and shared with clients via email, WhatsApp, or chat.

Client Signing Process

Client opens the secure link in their browser (no login required).

Document is displayed with signature placeholders.

Client reviews and signs the document digitally.

Once completed, the system automatically:

Saves the signed PDF.

Marks the document as “Signed” with timestamp and signer details.

Download & Sharing

Both manager and client can:

Download the signed PDF directly.

Share via Google Drive or similar storage integration.

Outcome / Value:

Completely eliminates paper-based signing.

Provides secure and verifiable digital signatures.

Simplifies sharing and storage of signed documents.

Saves time by avoiding scanning and manual emailing.

Feature 2: PDF Editing
User Story – Inline PDF Editing

As a manager,
I want to edit PDF documents directly in the platform,
so that I can make quick changes before sending for signature or sharing.

Scenario / Workflow:

Open PDF in Editor

Manager opens any PDF file using the built-in inline PDF editor.

Make Changes

Manager can:

Edit text fields (correct typos, update content).

Replace or resize images (e.g., logos, signatures).

Add or edit form fields.

Save Updated PDF

Changes are applied, and a new version of the PDF is generated.

Download or Share

Manager can:

Download the updated PDF to their device.

Share a secure Google Drive link directly from the system.

Version Tracking (Optional – Future Release)

System logs all edits for compliance and auditing purposes.

Outcome / Value:

Reduces back-and-forth emailing of draft versions.

Ensures documents are always shareable in standard PDF format.

Improves productivity by centralizing document preparation.
